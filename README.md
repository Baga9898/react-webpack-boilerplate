If you don't need any rules - just delete them or if something is missing - add them.</br>

### Linting fix
    npm run lint:fix

When executing this script, ESLint checks if it can fix the found rule inconsistencies in `.eslintrc` and fixes them.</br>
</br>
It does not fix everything, for example, the console.log will not be removed because ESLint does not know if you need it.
